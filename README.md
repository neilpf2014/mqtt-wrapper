# mqtt-wrapper

## My MQTT examples for class

Has the wrapper class that hides some of the uglyness, probably only works on ESP8266 / ESP32
Also 2 examples as cpp and not *.ino, these are intended for use in Platform IO / VS code IDE.
Fully intend for the LED example to be used with node red [../node-red/node-red]
this has dependancy on [../knolleary/pubsubclient]
