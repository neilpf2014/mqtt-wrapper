# mqtt-wrapper

## My MQTT examples for class

Has the wrapper class that hides some of the uglyness, probably only works on ESP8266 / ESP32

Also 2 examples as cpp and not *.ino, these are intended for use in Platform IO / VS code IDE

Fully intend for the LED example to be used with [node red](https://github.com//node-red/node-red)

The code here has dependancy on [/knolleary/pubsubclient](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient)
